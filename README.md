Asus XG-C100* requires: 1500rpm fan or more, depending on Ambient Â°C.
Heatsink is Big, Pretty, but is too far from Marvell / Aquantia IC with a foam.

Will shutdown IF over heats.
an over heats very easy with 800rpm case fan.

Asus has a Dumb ass working in heatsink design.
this happens since Asus Rampage III Extreme X58 era "since 2010".
